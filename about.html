        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I'm Adeniyi Peter, a dedicated Frontend Developer with a passion for creating seamless and visually appealing web experiences. My journey in web development started with a fascination for how code can bring designs to life. I specialize in modern frameworks like Angular and styling tools like Tailwind CSS, always aiming for clean, maintainable code that prioritizes user experience.

        <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
        <p>
          In this program, my primary goals are to deepen my expertise in frontend technologies, build a robust portfolio of multi-page applications, and gain hands-on experience with advanced topics like accessibility and performance optimization. I also aim to collaborate with peers, learn best practices, and prepare myself for real-world development challenges.

      <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          While I'm confident in frontend fundamentals, I have lower confidence in areas like backend integration, server-side rendering, and complex state management in large-scale applications. I'm also working on improving my skills in testing frameworks and CI/CD pipelines, as these are crucial for professional development but less familiar to me currently.

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          Remember to stay curious and keep learningâ€”technology evolves quickly, so embrace change. Focus on writing code that's not just functional but also elegant and scalable. Don't forget to balance work with hobbies like watching football and listening to music to avoid burnout. You've got this; keep pushing boundaries!

        <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          I'm excited about the potential of AI in web development and how it can streamline workflows. Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new tech gadgets and reading articles on emerging trends. This program is a great opportunity to turn my passion into a stronger skill set, and I'm looking forward to the growth ahead.
